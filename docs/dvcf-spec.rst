The DVCF specification defines an extension to the VCF format (fully compliant with the `VCF specification <https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf>`_).

The specificiation is independent of the Genozip software, and all creators of software the converts a VCF file from one coordinate system to another are encouraged to output the VCF with the additional annotations and meta-information lines defined in the DVCF specification, to enable interoperability between tools.
