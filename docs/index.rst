Genozip is a universal compressor for genomic files - it is optimized to compress FASTQ, SAM/BAM/CRAM, VCF/BCF, FASTA, GVF, Phylip and 23andMe files, but it can also compress any other file (including non-genomic files). 

It can even compress files that are already compressed with .gz .bz2 .xz (for full list of supported file types see ``genozip --help=input``).

The compression ratio one can expect to see depends on the data being compressed - it is typically about a 1.5-3X ratio when compressing .bam, 2X-5X for .fastq.gz files (i.e. compressing already-compressed files), and up to 200X when compressing an uncompressed high-sample-count .vcf file with only GT data or a Multi-FASTA file with similar contigs.

The compression is lossless - the decompressed file is 100% identical to the original file (except when using the ``--optimize`` option).

While Genozip was designed primarily to allow cost-effective storage and fast transmission of genomic files, it also includes extensive options that allow direct use of genozip-compressed files in analytical pipelines.

Genozip consists of four command line tools:
  
   - :doc:`genozip` compresses files
  
   - :doc:`genounzip` decompresses files

   - :doc:`genocat` is the workhorse for using genozip in analytical pipelines:
      - Display the contents of a compressed file - possibly piping it into a downstream tool
      - Subset a compressed file - show a specific part of its contents
      - Translate a compressed file to another format (eg BAM to FASTQ or Multi-FASTA to Phylip)
      - Show various statistics and metadata related to a compressed file
  
   - :doc:`genols` is similar to ls, just for compressed files
