=============================

Genozip is a small business that strives to create the world's best genomic data compression tools. We hope that by doing so we can make our small contribution to the genomics revolution that improves human lives in so many ways - better food, better medicine, fighting pandemics, conserving our nature and better understanding our past just to name a few.

We are not funded by any external source and we refrain from taking any taxpayer money in the form of grants or subsidies. We therefore kindly request that if your hard work of handling genomic data ultimately results in bread or rice on your family's table and revenue for your organization, you also respect our hard work by honestly paying us our very reasonable subscription fee.

**Examples of applications that *require* paying a subscription fee:**

- Clinical: The genomic data is processed with intent of directly benefiting the individual who provided the sample, for example via better diagnosis or treatment.

- Product: You are developing a product, such as a pharmaceutical, cosmetics or food product. 

- Commercial: You are providing a service to your customers, such as DNA sequencing, DNA analysis, bioinformatics, SaaS or cloud.

**Examples of applications that *do not require* paying a subscription fee:**

- Academic: You are analyzing ancient DNA to research the peopling of Europe.

- Academic: You are conducing a GWAS study, with the primary objective being publishing the results in a scientific journal.
  
- Training: You are teaching a course in bioinformatics, using Genozip to teach data compression.

- Evaluation: You may use Genozip for 30 days to see whether Genozip fits your needs, ahead of a decision of whether to subscribe.

- Decompression: No subscription is required for decompressing files previously compressed with Genozip, and you may freely transfer Genozip-compressed files to other people or organizations.
