Commercial license
==================

Use of Genozip in a commercial setting requires a commercial license.

We offer a commercial license that is simple, transparent and reasonably priced.

All options are for an organization-wide license, that permit unlimited use of ``genozip`` on any computer owned or leased by the organization, including cloud compute resources.

The pricing is as follows:

============  =========================  ============
License name  Organization type          Price
============  =========================  ============
SME           Annual revenue up to $1M   $500 / year
Corporate     Annual revenue $1M-$50M    $2000 / year
Enterprise    Annual revenue above $50M  $8000 / year
============  =========================  ============

    | - All monetary figures are in US Dollars, and prices are exclusive of VAT / GST / Sales tax, if applicable.
    |
    | - Only the use of ``genozip`` (the compression tool) requires a commercial license. ``genounzip`` and ``genocat`` (the decompression tools) are always available under the non-commercial license, even in a commercial setting. Therefore, you may share compressed files with third parties, and those third parties would not require a commercial license to access them. Also, importantly, you can continue to access your compressed data even after your license expires.

    | - A "commercial setting" includes any for-profit entity, and also includes any non-profit entity operating a commercial activity (such as hospital, clinical lab, research services organization etc). In short, if you have clients paying you for your services which involve processing genomic data, you require a commercial license. 
    |
    | - If you plan to provide a software solution to your clients that incorporates Genozip, each client will need their own license. 
    |
    | - Payment is annual.
