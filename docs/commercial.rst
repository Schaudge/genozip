Licensing Genozip
==================

Genozip is a small business that strives to create the world's best genomic data compression tools. Developing Genozip and supporting its users is what we do for a living. We have not sought or received any external funding. We proudly contribute our work, free, for advancement of science - and fund it by charging commercial or clinical users a licensing fee. 

In short, if all you are doing with your genomic data is making scientific discoveries and publishing them in scientific journals, then please go ahead and use Genozip for free. On the other hand, if handling genomic data ultimately generates revenue for your organization, we ask that you respect us and our hard work by purchasing a license.

The :ref:`Genozip License <license>` defines the exact cases for which use of Genozip is free. To illustrate, here are some examples:

**Examples of applications for which use of Genozip is FREE:**

- Academic: You are conducing a study, with the primary objective being publishing the results in a scientific journal.
  
- Training: You are teaching a course in bioinformatics, using Genozip to teach data compression.

- Evaluation: You may use Genozip for 30 days to see whether Genozip fits your needs, ahead of a decision of whether to purchase a license.

- Decompression: decompressing files previously compressed with Genozip is free.

- Distribution: Distributing the Genozip software to others, for example, as a module on an HPC, is free. Each user will need to register individually.

**Examples of applications that require paying a licensing fee:**

- Clinical: The genomic data is used to directly benefit the individuals who provided the samples, for example via better diagnosis or treatment.

- Product: You are developing a product, such as a pharmaceutical or food product. 

- Service: You are providing a service to your customers, such as DNA sequencing, DNA analysis, bioinformatics, SaaS or cloud.
