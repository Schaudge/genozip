Subscribing to use Genozip
===========================
*Using Genozip with data generated in a clinical or commercial setting*

Genozip is a small business that strives to create the world's best genomic data compression tools. We hope that by doing so we can make our small contribution to the genomics revolution that improves human lives in so many ways - better food, better medicine, fighting pandemics, conserving our nature and better understanding our past just to name a few.

Developing Genozip and supporting its users is what we do for a living. We refrain from taking any taxpayer money in the form of grants or subsidies, and we also do not receive funding from any external body. We therefore kindly request that if your hard work of handling genomic data puts bread or rice on your family's table and generates revenue for your organization, you also respect our hard work by honestly paying us our very reasonable subscription fee.

**Examples of applications that *require* paying a subscription fee:**

- Product: You are developing a product, such as a pharmaceutical, cosmetics or food product. 

- Commercial: You are providing a service to your customers, such as DNA sequencing, DNA analysis, bioinformatics, SaaS or cloud.

**Examples of applications that *do not require* paying a subscription fee:**

- Academic: You are analyzing ancient DNA to research the peopling of Europe.

- Academic: You are conducing a study, with the primary objective being publishing the results in a scientific journal.
