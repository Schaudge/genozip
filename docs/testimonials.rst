*I form part of the team working on the TargetID research project at the University of Malta, which is using RNA-seq and whole genome sequencing to find suitable drug targets that will prevent COVID-19 induced cytokine storms. Our pipelines were generating data at higher rates than our initial estimate, and we needed to free up some storage. Standard file compressors weren't cutting it, and while researching file-specific compressors I encountered 'Genozip'. At first I was sceptical of its claimed compression ratios and ability to compress CRAM files, but I was able to reproduce these results on our own files. We have now incorporated genozip into our pipelines which has reduced our initial estimate of 205TB to a new estimate of 55TB. I was pleasantly surprised with Genozip and I recommend it to those encountering similar storage space issues.*
