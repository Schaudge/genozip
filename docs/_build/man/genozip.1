"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code
, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including
but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

"Executable" shall mean a type of Object, for which there exists an operating system of a computing device, for which
said operating system is capable of running said Object as an operating system process.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as
indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work

display, publicly perform, and distribute the Work in Source or Object form (together: "Using"), subject to the
following details:

   a. This license does NOT permit creation of Derivative Works, and does not permit distributing modified Source or
Object based on modified Source

   b. This license does NOT permit Using the features of the Work intended for compressing data, including the genozip
Executable, for any purpose except b1,b2,b3,b4 hereinafter if (i). you are a commercial entity or working on behalf or
for the benefit of a commercial entity; and/or (ii). the use of the Work is in the context of a project that has
ultimate commerical goals.

form or Object derived from unmodified Source, and including this License via a platform that is both publicly
accessible and free of charge, including but not limited to an Internet website

      b4. This license DOES permit Using, including reproducing and distributing, the three Executables genounzip,
genocat and genols for any purpose including commercial.

   c. This license DOES NOT permit compressing a file, unless the uncompressed file is also kept or the potential loss
of data due to genozip not being able to uncompress the compressed file would not cause any harm.

3. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any software source code intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall imply complete and irrevocable assignment by You to Copyright
Owner of all copyright in the submitted source code.

Genozip is a universal compressor for genomic files \- it is optimized to compress FASTQ, SAM/BAM/CRAM, VCF/BCF, FASTA, GVF, Phylip and 23andMe files, but it can also compress any other file (including non\-genomic files).
.sp
It can even compress files that are already compressed with .gz .bz2 .xz (for full list of supported file types see \fBgenozip \-\-help=input\fP).
.sp
The compression ratio one can expect to see depends on the data being compressed \- it is typically about a 1.5\-3X ratio when compressing .bam, 2X\-5X for .fastq.gz files (i.e. compressing already\-compressed files), and up to 200X when compressing an uncompressed high\-sample\-count .vcf file with only GT data or a Multi\-FASTA file with similar contigs.
.sp
The compression is lossless \- the decompressed file is 100% identical to the original file (except when using the \fB\-\-optimize\fP option).
.sp
While Genozip was designed primarily to allow cost\-effective storage and fast transmission of genomic files, it also includes extensive options that allow direct use of genozip\-compressed files in analytical pipelines.
.sp
The command line options are similar to gzip and samtools/bcftools, so if you are familiar with these, it works pretty much the same. To get started, try: \fBgenozip \-\-help\fP\&.
