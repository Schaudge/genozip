Using Genozip on an HPC
=======================

Genozip requires registration prior to use, and its a violation of Genozip's license to use Genozip without registration.

However, in some environments, interactive registration is not possible. For example, when submitting a batch job to an HPC.

In these environments, do the following:

| 1. Register Genozip on another computer with ``genozip --register``. You can skip this step if you have already used (and hence registered) Genozip on this computer. 
| 
| âž” The license file located at ``~/.genozip_license`` on Linux and Mac and ``%APPDATA%\genozip\.genozip_license`` on Windows.
|
| 2. Copy the license file to the target computer (any directory, any filename). 
|
| 3. Use the ``--licfile`` option to point genozip to the license file, for example:

::

    genozip --licfile mydir/.genozip_license mydata.bam
