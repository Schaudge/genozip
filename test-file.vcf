## WHAT IS THIS FILE? This is a test file for testing edge cases during development on genozip. It is not a normal
## VCF file and results in many warnings when running genozip against it - this is expected
##
## Things tested in this file
# 1. lines with and without non-GT subfields
# 2. lines with and without GT subfields
# 3. GL fields - GL optimization
# 4. lines that are missing samples
# 5. subfields that start with "GT" but are not GT ("GTNOT" here)
# 6. samples that are missing the first subfield declared in FORMAT
# 7. samples that are missing the last subfield declared in FORMAT
# 8. INFO fields with multiple info subfields
# 9. INFO fields with subfields that have a name but no value
# 10. Two-digit allele value 
# 11. Missing (.) allele value 
# 12. Increase in ploidy between lines
# 13. Increase in ploidy mid-line
# 14. Positive, negative and zero POS field deltas
# 15. Change in CHROM value between lines
# 16. Format and info subfield names that exceed 8 characters (DictIdType size)
# 17. Lines with different ploidy types: HAPLO, PHASED, NOT_PHASED and MIXED 
# 18. No FORMAT and samples in a line, despite file having samples
# 19. Extreme POS values (0 and ‭2147483647‬ == 0x7ffffff)
