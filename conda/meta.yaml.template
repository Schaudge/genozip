  summary: 'Compressor for VCF genomic files, a lot better than gzip or bzip2'

  description: |
    vczip is a compressor for VCF genomic files (it compresses .vcf or .vcf.gz files). 
    It is very easy to use - in fact, if you're familiar with gzip, it works pretty much the same.
    It achieves x2 to x5 better compression ratios than gzip because it leverages some properties
    of the genomic data, such as linkage disequilibrium, to compress better. 
    It is also a lot faster than gzip. 
    The compression is lossless - the decompressed file is identical to the original file.
