purpose attached to that particular License Type, and\par
subject to the terms and conditions of this License\par
agreement:\par
\par
   a. Academic License: For academic research, educational\par

registered student at such an institution, but excluding\par

   b. Using Genozip to compress a file is only permitted if\par
the file is retained in its original form as well or the\par
potential loss of data due to Genozip not being able to\par
