3. Additional Terms and conditions<br><br>
   a. You must fully and accurately complete the registration, either by completing the registeration as prompted by the genozip tool or by receiving registration confirmation after registering by emailing register@genozip.com.<br><br>
   b. Using Genozip to compress a file is only permitted if the file is retained in its original form as well or the potential loss of data due to Genozip not being able to uncompress the compressed file would not cause any harm.<br><br>
   c. Any changes to the Genozip's source code and/or creation of Derivative Works and/or reverse-engineering of Genozip and/or using all or part of Genozip's source code (even if modified) in another software package are forbidden, unless prior written permission is obtained from Licensor.<br><br>

   e. Reselling Genozip and/or selling a service or a product that includes Genozip or any part of Genozip's code or algorithms (together, "Genozip Technology") such that a user of said service or product may directly or indirectly effectuate compression or decompression of data using Genozip Tecnology - permission for such reselling or selling is not granted in this license, and requires a separate reseller or OEM license. To clarify, merely delivering Genozip-compressed files to others (e.g. your clients or collaborators) IS included in the Standard and/or Academic License and IS NOT subject to this restriction.<br><br>
