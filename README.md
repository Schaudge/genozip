# genozip
Compression tool for VCF (Variant Call Format) files - a LOT better than gzip, bgzip and bzip2

It typically achieves compression of x2 - x5 better that gzip, and is faster than it, too. The compression is lossless, i.e. the files decompressed are 100% identical to the originals.

The command line options are very much similar to gzip, bzip2 etc, so if you're familiar with these, it works pretty much the same. Try genozip --help to get started.

To build - just run "make". It is tested to work on Mac, Windows, Linux.
