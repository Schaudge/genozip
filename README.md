<h1>Genozip</h1><br>
<br>
(available on <b>Conda</b>, <b>Docker Hub</b> and https://github.com/divonlan/genozip ; Documentation: http://genozip.com)<br>
<br>
<b>Genozip</b> is a compressor for genomic files - while it can compress any file (i.e. not only genomic files), it is optimized to compress FASTQ, SAM/BAM/CRAM, VCF/BCF, FASTA, GVF, PHYLIP, Chain and 23andMe files.<br>

<br> 
Typically, a <b>2X-5X improvement over the existing compression</b> is achieved when compressing already-compressed files like .fastq.gz .bam vcf.gz and much higher ratios in some other cases.<br> 
<br> 
<b>Yes</b>, Genozip can compress already-compressed files (.gz .bz2 .xz .bam .cram).<br> 
<br> 
The compression is <b>lossless</b> - the decompressed file is 100% identical to the original file (see documentation for exceptions).<br>

The command line options are similar to gzip and samtools/bcftools, so if you are familiar with these, it works pretty much the same. To get started, see: http://genozip.com<br>
