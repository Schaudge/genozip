- --split option - required storing the VCF header of all files, and keeping md5 for both the concatenated file and each components
- Improvement in memory and thread management - to reduce memory consumption when compressing very large files (100s of GB to TBs)
- Separate --help text for each command
- Optimize MD5 performance (move to 32b and eliminate memory copying)
- Many bug fixes.
